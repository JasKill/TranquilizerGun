# Tranquilizer Gun 2.0
Remade from the ground, here it's the long awaited Tranquilizer Gun plugin! Allowing you to sleep both players and SCPs (Highly configurable).

### What does it do?
This plugin lets you put people to sleep using a pistol randomly found in LCZ & HCZ, one shot uses all your ammo and you will need to shoot SCPs twice to put them to sleep (Everything here is configurable, even the weapon!).

### Installation
As with any EXILED plugin, you must place the TranquilizerGun 2.0.dll file inside of your "EXILED-PTB\Plugins" folder. (Inside %appdata% on Windows)

And... obviously include [EXILED](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED "EXILED").

### Commands
Arguments inside &lt;&gt; are required. [] means it's optional.
| Command | Description |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ 
| `035`   | Test SCP-069 on the person who sent the message.|

### Configuration
Exiled 2.0 now has auto-generated config files, alongside documentation! So check out your config file for more information on it!


### Planned Changes:
**Open to suggestions**
